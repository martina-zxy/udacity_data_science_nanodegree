# Udacity Data Scientist Project: Write A Data Science Blog Post

## Introduction
In this project, I choose to do analysis on the [Covid Impact Survey](https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-impact-survey-public-data), which provides statistics about physical health, mental health, economic security and social dynamics related to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.

### Business Understanding
The analysis is driven by three main questions:

- How is the state of peopleâ€™s mental health after Covid strikes?
- On the economic aspect, how are the people who got furloughed getting help?
- How many people are taking various precautions for Covid?


### Data Understanding
The jupyter notebook  `covid_impact_survey_analysis.ipynb` in this directory shows how I perform the analysis to answer the questions. 
The survey data is pretty clean so there is not much preparation step needed beforehand. 

One important point about the data set is that it is a survey data with a population weight for each row. Therefore, the weight has to be taken into account should any calculation or aggreation is necessary. This has been done properly and can be seen in the jupyter notebook.

### Result
The result of the analysis shows that 
- Covid has caused some mental health issues in society and younger people tend to have higher probability of having some mental health symptoms,
- some people who have been furloughed are getting many types of help from the government and other organizations, 
- people are taking the necessary precautions for Covid. The latest result in June also showed that more Americans are wearing masks than at the beginning of the pandemic

This analysis is also explained in detail in a [Medium blog post](https://martina-megasari.medium.com/covid-impact-survey-analysis-70e2ddb38ff7).
